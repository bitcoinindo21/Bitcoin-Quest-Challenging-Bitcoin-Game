# Bitcoin-Quest-Challenging-Bitcoin-Game
Bitcoin Quest is a cooperative Bitcoin board game where you and your friends race toward true freedom. Arrows pull you down with fiat traps, rockets lift you with honest choices, and every turn is a step closer to discovering what freedom really means.

Bitcoin Quest is a thrilling üé≤ cooperative board game where you and your friends embark on an adventure to find true freedom through the world of Bitcoin. Inspired by Snakes and Ladders, every dice roll can send you soaring üöÄ with bold choices or drag you down üîª into the traps of fiat and fear. Along the way, you‚Äôll uncover lessons about money, trust, and perseverance while chasing the dream of decentralization together. No rewards, no tokens. Just teamwork, laughter, and the journey toward real financial freedom üü†.
